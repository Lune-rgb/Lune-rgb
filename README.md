### Hi there 👋

🏫 I'm currently a Bachelor student in Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.

🌱 I’m currently learning linguistics & computer science.

🔭 I’m currently working on building natural language datasets, natural language embedding & knowledge graph for scientific discoveries.

🤔 I’m looking for help on how to dive further into the field of natural language processing 
                          (e.g. to make use of neural networks & big pre-trained models...)

💭 I'm dreaming of the computer's better acquiring human knowledge in the future.

⚡ Fun fact: 💡 also interested in graphic design & European philosophy
            💡 "lune", the French word "moon", relates to my real name "tide"
            💡 while "RGB" stands for a wider scope of the colorful world
